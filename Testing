Test cases documentation 

Testerbank.js - was created by both Nicholas and Kevin, it just uses the eth library 
to transfer and send tokens into a few accounts. This was a mixed of javascript functions 
to do a mini testing on understanding how web3 and eth libraries played in it.

For testbank.js, the contributors are Kevin and Nicholas where they mainly worked 
with TransactionFactory and its respective functions. The numbers or equivalence 
classes decided on are rather simple to make sure the setters and getters functions 
are working with each individual accounts. They mainly range from [0, 10, 100, -100].

For test.js, the contributors are David and Zack. Zack also worked on 
the module, TransactionFactory, and its respective functions as well. This 
is mainly due to the fact there was last minute changes on TokenTransaction 
which rendered all test cases useless. For David, he tested on some close 
numbers like [10, 15, 20, 3460, 1] and one extremely large number for the heck of it.
The numbers in the list are for testing purpose to see if TokenTransaction 
inherited all of the functions/values from TransactionFactory. The deposit and 
transferEnergy are for the purpose of seeing if Enits and Ethers could be 
converted to each other for sales.
